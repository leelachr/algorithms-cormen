#lang racket

; notes/todo:
; - use vectors instead of arrays for 1-d arrays.
;   (if they're mutable.)
; - is it fundamentally different to build a list
;   and use an upper bound as a starting criteria
;   rather than zero. (build from a natural num.)
; - use hungarian prefix to show where i am using
;   lists v. arrays v. mutable arrays, etc.
; - test suite, rename example data.
; - note: rule is that (for consistency), whenever
;   i turn a value from unsorted (A) into an index
;   i must sub1 from the unsorted value.
; - difference between settable-array and mutable-
;   array in racket?

; 1. create empty

; occur in the unsorted input A.

; each element i in new array is sum of ith and i-1th
; elements in old array. the zeroth element just keeps
; its value, as there is no -1th value.
; this procedure could easily be modified to combine
; the two previous elements in any way and to accept
; any base case.
